foomod.zip - includes needed files for playing map "MYTOAN Sniper",
             also includes unlit map and lighting solution which
             can be loaded in to LightingTool

mytoan_cm_fix.zip - Almost working command map, original is less useful.
                    Because of stupid command map system in Ghost Recon
                    it is impossible to get "full screen" command map
                    in small maps, with this cm it is possible to guide
                    AI and see your own position on command map though

foomod_level_MAX5.zip - includes MAX5 scene, textures are in
                        foomod.zip (doesn't work with previous
                        versions of MAX)

You may freely modify and distribute the level and so on. Just
give the credit whom it belongs to.

What you may not do, is: use any parts of the scene in your
animations / pictures / anything non-related with the modding scene
of Ghost Recon.

INSTALL
Unzip in to Ghost Recon's mod-folder (...\Ghost Recon\Mods\ -folder)
and activate mod under Ghost Recon's options/mods tab.

Quick mission -> MYTOAN Sniper -> play
Doesn't support any other multiplayer mode than "team mission",
would you like to fix this (siege, and so on would be nice)?-)

Meprolite has made small but working command map, you can download
fix mytoan_cm_fix.zip
